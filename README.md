# Git Notifier Discord Bot
Git discord bot idea to keep simple updates to discord channels on:
* Commits
* Merges
* Pull Requests
* Releases
* Maybe more when I think of them
I am thinking of either having all messages either link to a channel in a server or just have multiple channels to handle different repositories.

## Other Considerations
Another thing I've considered is handle organizations/issues/etc.  
An alternative to this is to have a trello integration for when:
* Cards update/change for a card (when someone hits "Save" when updating a card on Trello)
* People are added to cards/assigned
* When a date changes for a certain card
* When something has been completed/checked off on a checklist that a card might have
So it would be a Git/Trello Discord Bot (OR maybe known as a simple Agile Bot, but then I'd have to handle more things too)
