Sometimes it's annoying to go on GitHub or ask my friends if they made changes to the codebase. So, I want to create a bot that will notify me if changes are made to a repository so I don't need to ask or check. It would also be cool if the bot displays the diff into a codeblock on discord to see what was added!

## Ideas
Git discord bot idea to keep simple updates to discord channels on:
* Commits
* Merges
* Pull Requests
* Releases
* Issues
* Maybe more when I think of them
I am thinking of either having all messages either link to a channel in a server or just have multiple channels (maybe even 1 thread per repository) to handle different repositories.

## Other Considerations
Another thing I've considered is handle organizations/issues/etc.  
An alternative to this is to have a trello integration for when:
* Cards update/change for a card (when someone hits "Save" when updating a card on Trello)
* People are added to cards/assigned
* When a date changes for a certain card
* When something has been completed/checked off on a checklist that a card might have
So it would be a Git/Trello Discord Bot (OR maybe known as a simple Agile Bot, but then I'd have to handle more things too)

Something to consider in terms of accounts and running scripts!!!
* The Bot is it's own Discord User and Trello Account!
* When making requests, it will be acting on it's own for listening to boards/workspaces
    * What might be security risks for this as a Trello account?

## Resources
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    * This project will use `v18.18.2` so that nodemon will work properly, `v18.19.0` and up does not work for some reason.
    * Consider using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md#about) for multiple node versions.
